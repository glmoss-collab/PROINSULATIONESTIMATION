# AI-Powered PDF Extraction Setup Guide

The HVAC Insulation Estimator now includes AI-powered automatic extraction of specifications, measurements, and project information from your PDFs using Google's Gemini API.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Free Gemini API Key

1. **Go to**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Click**: "Create API Key"

## How It Works

### üéØ What the AI Can Extract

#### From Specification PDFs:
- ‚úÖ **All insulation specifications** (material, thickness, facing)
- ‚úÖ **System types** (duct, pipe, equipment)
- ‚úÖ **Size ranges** for each spec
- ‚úÖ **Special requirements** (outdoor, jacketing, mastic, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Project information** (name, location, contractor, date)

#### From Drawing PDFs:
- ‚úÖ **Duct measurements** (sizes, lengths, fittings)
- ‚úÖ **Pipe measurements** (diameters, lengths, fittings)
- ‚úÖ **Locations** and area descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Fitting counts** (elbows, tees, crosses)
- ‚úÖ **Elevation changes** and vertical runs

### üìã Usage Steps

1. **Upload Specification PDF**
   - Click "Upload Specification PDF"
   - Select your project specs (mechanical/insulation section)

2. **Upload Drawing PDF (Optional)**
   - Click "Upload Drawing PDF (Optional)"
   - Select your mechanical drawings

3. **Click "ü§ñ AI Extract Specs & Measurements"**
   - AI analyzes both PDFs (30-60 seconds)
   - Watch progress in real-time

4. **Review Results**
   - Project info appears in header
   - Specifications shown in table
   - Measurements added automatically
   - Make any needed adjustments manually

5. **Calculate Estimate**
   - Proceed to calculation step
   - Download quotes and material lists

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's

- **Use clear, scanned PDFs** - Better quality = better extraction
- **Upload full spec sections** - Include all insulation specs
- **Review AI results** - Always verify extracted data
- **Combine PDFs** - Upload both specs and drawings together
- **Use consistent formats** - Standard specification formats work best

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't upload hand-drawn sketches** - AI works best with typed/printed docs
- **Don't upload photos of paper** - Use actual PDF files
- **Don't skip verification** - AI is smart but not perfect
- **Don't upload huge files** - Split large drawing sets into sections

---

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid" Error

**Problem**: API key not recognized

**Solutions**:
1. Check you copied the full key (starts with "AIza")
2. Make sure no extra spaces
3. Verify key is active at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
4. Generate a new key if needed

### "No Specifications Found" Warning

**Problem**: AI couldn't extract specs

**Solutions**:
1. Check PDF has actual insulation specifications
2. Look for spec tables or specification text
3. Try uploading just the insulation/mechanical section
4. Use manual entry for unusual formats
5. Use "üìÑ Basic Text Extract" as fallback

### "Quota Exceeded" Error

**Problem**: Hit API rate limits

**Solutions**:
1. **Free tier limits**:
   - Wait 1 minute (15 requests/minute limit)
   - Wait until tomorrow (1,500 requests/day limit)
2. **Upgrade** to paid plan if needed
3. **Process smaller batches** of PDFs

### "AI is Slow" Issue

**Problem**: Extraction takes too long

**Expected**:
- Small PDFs (1-10 pages): 10-30 seconds
- Medium PDFs (10-30 pages): 30-60 seconds
- Large PDFs (30+ pages): 60-120 seconds

**Solutions**:
1. Split large PDFs into sections
2. Upload only relevant pages
3. Be patient - quality extraction takes time

## Cost & Limits

### Free Tier (Google AI Studio)

**Limits**:
- 15 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day
- 1 million tokens per day

**Typical Usage**:
- 1 spec PDF = 1-3 requests
- 1 drawing PDF = 2-5 requests
- **You can process 100-300 projects per day for FREE**

### Paid Tier (Google Cloud)

If you need more:
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: $0.075 per 1M tokens (very cheap!)
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: $1.25 per 1M tokens (best quality)

**Cost estimate**:
- Process 1,000 projects/month: ~$5-10
- Process 10,000 projects/month: ~$50-100

Still way cheaper than manual data entry!
